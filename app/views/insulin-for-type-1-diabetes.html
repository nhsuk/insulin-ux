      <p class="nhsuk-lede-text">Insulin is a medicine that helps your body use glucose (sugar) for energy.</p>
      <p class="nhsuk-lede-text">If you have type 1 diabetes, your body cannot produce insulin. You'll need to be prescribed insulin to stop your blood glucose from getting too high.</p>

      <h2>How you take insulin</h2>
      <p>You inject insulin using an insulin pen. This is a device that helps you inject safely and take the right dose.</p>
      <p>Some people use an <a href="javascript: void(0)">insulin pump</a> instead of a pen. This is a device you attach to your body that gives you small amounts of insulin throughout the day and night.</p>
      <p>When you're first prescribed insulin you'll be shown how to use your pen or your pump.</p>
      <p>Read about <a href="javascript: void(0)">things to help if youâ€™re newly diagnosed</a>, including managing blood glucose and how to inject insulin.</p>

      <h2>Types of insulin for type 1 diabetes</h2>
      <p>Most people with type 1 diabetes take both:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a long acting insulin (also called background or basal insulin) once or twice a day</li>
        <li>a rapid acting insulin (also called mealtime or bolus insulin) before meals</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This combination is sometimes known as a basal bolus regime.</p>
      <p>You'll need to calculate your rapid acting insulin dose for each meal, depending on the amount of carbohydrates you'll be eating (carb counting).</p>
      <p>If you use an insulin pump, you'll only need rapid acting insulin. Your pump will give you small doses throughout the day so you do not need to take a long acting insulin.</p>
      <p>Your doctor or care team will recommend the insulin treatment they think is best for you. The type of insulin you take and your dose may change over time.</p>
      <h3>Long acting insulin</h3>
      <p>Your doctor will usually recommend taking <a href="javascript: void(0)">insulin detemir (Levemir)</a> twice a day.</p>
      <p>If you cannot take insulin detemir or you prefer to have fewer injections, your doctor may recommend <a href="javascript: void(0)">insulin glargine (Lantus)</a> once a day.</p>
      <p>If you get low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia, or hypos) at night, or you need help from a carer to take injections, your doctor might recommend a type of insulin that lasts for longer, called <a href="javascript: void(0)">insulin degludec (Tresiba)</a>. It's taken once a day.</p>

      <h3>Rapid acting insulin</h3>
      <p>Your doctor will usually recommend either:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="javascript: void(0)">insulin aspart (NovoRapid or Fiasp)</a></li>
        <li><a href="javascript: void(0)">insulin lispro (Humalog)</a></li>
        <li><a href="javascript: void(0)">insulin glulisine (Apidra)</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>You'll need to take this around 10 to 20 minutes before each meal.</p>
      <p>Insulin aspart works more quickly than insulin lispro or insulin glulisine so you can leave a shorter gap before eating.</p>
